# Concept
IP is most commonly the abbreviation of Intellectual Property. However in this document Intellectual Product is a more accurate term.

IP, is a human mental construct, an abstract concept, an idea that has no embodiment in it's pure form. Many things can be considered as an IP such as: a story, a description, an algorithm, a song, a piece of program code... etc. These IPs created in the head of people, which can be considered as the primer embodiment. Further forms can be implemented with the help of transfer mediums.  
## Working on IPs
All IP has the same basic properties:
- Creation: An IP can be created. With the help of existing knowledge (other IPs) and some creativity one can come up with a new IP.
- Transformation: An IP can be transformed. Akin to the previous point the original IP can be transformed into a different form. Matter of fact, it is how it exists, because the pure form is different for each individual who has the knowledge of it.
- Deletion: An IP can be cease to exist. An IP exists as long as there is one individual who has it in their head, or there is any medium that contains it. If that is no longer the case, the IP is forgotten.
## Further Properties of IPs
- Transfer: IPs created in their pure form, but that can not be interpreted by other individuals, therefore in order to share the IP, one has to encode it in a way that can be deciphered by others. The encoded IP then has to be mapped in a transfer medium that is suitable for communication. Then the transfer medium can be shared with others who can convert the IP back to the pure form.
  Transfer medium can be the spoken language, written text, a video...etc.
- Costs: The material cost of a single IP is negligible for a society. Even considering it's transfer mediums and the cost of duplication, it takes a low amount of material goods to create, store, share and maintain in IP.
- Author: An IP has no owner, since it is impossible to own a concept, but all IPs have authors. E.g. if someone tells a genuine story to another person, the author will not own the story in the head of the audience, but still remains the author.
